Golang / SDL Game - This is a space shooter game called "Alien Buster" where a player will be busting alien ships and destroying them before they land on take over planet earth! 

Your mission is to destroy all enemy spaceships or our planet will be invaded and it will be your fault! 

This is a component oriented architecture but each element is kept on a separate package. 

I will be adding more levels, enemies, player, and weapons options over time.

please feel free to submit any updates and I will be happy to integrate them. Any graphics will be much appreciated too! If you have any question please let me know. 

Happy coding everyone!
